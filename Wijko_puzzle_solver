"""Wijuko Puzzle Solver in Python

This program is coded in in Python to solve Wijuko grid puzzle
Place 1-9 in the grid, obeying constraints for the sums between pairs of squares.
Here's the template, where X is the number 1..9 in the  square to be found. c1,c2,..,c12 are constraint numbers given that numbers in the squares at two sides of it (vertical or horizontal) add up to that constraint number

The other constraints are that every number 1..9 is to be used once and all cells 1..9 are filled with one number.

   X c1  X c2  X
   c3    c4    c5
   X c6  X c7  X
   c8    c9    c10
   X c11 X c12 X 

 See Martin J. Chlond: "Puzzle - IP in the I"
 http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/ited.2015.0142

The program has two options for input: user may decide to enter the constraints manually or may use the default constraint list hard-coded into it.

The hard-coded input, defined from the problem instance from Chlond's article is:

 "0,7,12,8,13,0,14,7,0,15,0,0"

For the following puzzle:

    X  _  X    7  X   

   12     8   13    

    X  _  X   14  X

    7     _       15

    X  _  X   _    X 

The program finds the solution to this problem as:

    9     2    5

    3     6    8

    4     1    7


Another example set of constraints that can be entered is:  

	9,7,10,8,0,0,0,0,0,9,13,10

   Solution should be:

    7     2    5

    3     6    8

    4     9    1
